# Pancho and Lefty
> Capo 2nd fret

{Intro}
Finger pick A to Bm

{Verse 1}
[D] Living on the road my friend
[A] Was gonna keep you free and clean
[G] Now you wear your skin like iron
Your [D] breath's as [A] hard as kerosene
[G] You weren't your mama's only boy
But her [D] favorite one [G] it seems
[Bm] She began to cry when you [G] said
good[A]bye
And [G] sank into your [Bm] dreams

{Verse 2}
[D] Pancho was a bandit boys
[A] His horse was fast as polished steel
[G] Wore his gun outside his pants
For [D] all the honest [A] world to feel
[G] Pancho met his match you know
On [D] the deserts down in [G] Mexico
[Bm] Nobody heard his [G] dying words
[A]
That's [G] the way it [Bm] goes

{Chorus}
[G] All the federales say
They [D] could have had him [G] any day
[Bm] They only let him [G] hang a[A]round
Out [G] of kindness I [Bm] suppose

{Verse 3}
[D] Lefty he can't sing the blues
[A] All night long like he used to
[G] The dust that Pancho bit down south
[D] Ended up in [A] Lefty's mouth
[G] The day they laid poor Pancho low
[D] Lefty split for [G] Ohio
[Bm] Where he got the [G] bread to [A] go
There [G] ain't nobody [Bm] knows

{Chorus}
[G] All the federales say
They [D] could have had him [G] any day
[Bm] They only let him [G] slip a[A]way
Out [G] of kindness I [Bm] suppose

{Verse 4}
[D] The poets tell how Pancho fell
[A] Lefty's livin' in a cheap hotel
[G] The desert's quiet and Cleveland's cold
So [D] the story [A] ends we're told
[G] Pancho needs your prayers it's true,
But [D] save a few for [G] Lefty too
[Bm] He just did what he [G] had to [A] do
Now [G] he's growing [Bm] old

{Outro Chorus}
[G] All the federales say
They [D] could have had him [G] any day
[Bm] They only let him [G] hang a[A]round
Out [G] of kindness I [Bm] suppose

[G] All the federales say
They [D] could have had him [G] any day
[Bm] They only let him [G] hang a[A]round
Out [G] of kindness I [Bm] suppose
